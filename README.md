## NYPL Book Manager

This experimental application, in its infancy, lists your checked out books along with their due dates
It can be run from the command line:
```
nypl-mgr.py -b <LIBRARY BARCODE> -p <PIN>
```

Use at your own risk. This is not a robust application and is in no way shape or 
form endorsed by or associated with the New York Public Library.
